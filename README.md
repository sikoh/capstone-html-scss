Hestia - WordPress theme




Replicate the Wordpress Theme - https://pcm.wordpress.org/themes/hestia/
- I want everything as close to perfect as you can get it.
- You will need to utilize nearly all of the concepts we've gone over so far.
- Use SCSS instead of pure css
  - You can use just one stylesheet to avoid the hassle of the preprocessor if you want.
- All Pages should should represented if there are links to them.
- I want to see at least 1 of each of the following:
 - variable
 - mixin
 - flexbox
 - grid
 - pseudo selectors (hover and focus are probably the two big ones)
 - media queries
 - imported fonts (try to match theirs as best you can if available)
These will probably come naturally based on that layout anyways. Don't just limit yourself to 1 though, really stretch yourself.
- I want this to look good on mobile. You do NOT have to have the hamburger icon dropdown menu, come up with a creative solution instead.
- You should be pushing your code to github as you go along, but you'll also submit your live Netlify link to me.
